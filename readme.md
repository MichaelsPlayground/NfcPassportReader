# NFC Passport Reader

This app is based on the work from this repository https://github.com/alimertozdemir/EPassportNFCReader.

All dependencies are up to date on May 26th 2022, the app runs on SDK >= 23 and is developed 
using Android SDK 32.

To read data from passports you need to provide three data fields:

- the **passport number**
- the **birth date in format YYMMDD**, e.g. 651023 for a birth day October 23rd 1965
- the **expiration date in format YYMMDD**, e.g. 251017 for an expiration day October 17th 2025

Mostly available are the data from data groups ("DG") 1 and 2, the other data groups require a more 
complex authorization that is e.g. available only for authorities like border patrol. 

As the reading of the data takes a lot of time (can be up to a minute) it is important to **LAY 
the smartphone on the passport and DO NOT MOVE the device** to avoid a tag lost exception.

I could test the app only with a German passport - kindly note that a German ID card ("Personalausweis") 
is not supported.

The NFC-reading task is using the mNfcAdapter.**enableReaderMode** as this is more stable than other modes. 
Additionally is runs the **onTagDiscovered** method in a background task so there is no need to use an 
AsyncTask or other methods.
